# Sprint Challenge: Authentication - Dad Jokes

## Description

In this challenge, you build a real wise-guy application. _Dad jokes_ are all the rage these days. Currently the application is trying to receive some `Dad Jokes`, however we are locked out.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment, please work on it alone. It is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

If the instructions are not clear, please seek support from your TL and Instructor on Slack.

The Minimum Viable Product must be completed in three hours.

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [X] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [X] Add your _Team Lead_ as collaborator on Github.
- [X] Clone your forked version of the Repository.
- [X] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b `firstName-lastName`.
- [X] Implement the project on this Branch, committing changes regularly.
- [X] Push commits: git push origin `firstName-lastName`.

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [X] Submit a Pull-Request to merge `firstName-lastName` branch into `master` on your fork. **Please don't make Pull Requests against Lambda's repository**.
- [X] Please don't merge your own pull request.
- [X] Add your _Team Lead_ as a Reviewer on the Pull-request
- [X] Your _Team Lead_ will count the challenge as done by merging the branch into _master_.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and use descriptive messages. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code) and your Team Lead.

## Self-Study/Essay Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.

- [X] What is the purpose of using _sessions_?

Session based authentication is one in which the user state is stored on the serverâ€™s memory. When using a session based auth system, the server creates and stores the session data in the server memory when the user logs in and then stores the session Id in a cookie on the user browser.

The session Id is then sent on subsequent requests to the server and the server compares it with the stored session data and proceeds to process the requested action.

- [X] What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner.

The bcrypt hashing function allows us to build a password security platform that scales with computation power and always hashes every password with a salt.

A better way to store passwords is to add a salt to the hashing process: adding additional random data to the input of a hashing function that makes each password hash unique. The ideal authentication platform would integrate these two processes, hashing and salting, seamlessly.

- [X] What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers?

bcrypt runs in two phases:

Phase 1:

A function called EksBlowfishSetup is setup using the desired cost, the salt, and the password to initialize the state of eksblowfish. Then, bcrypt spends a lot of time running an expensive key schedule which consists of performing a key derivation where we derive a set of subkeys from a primary key. Here, the password is used as the primary key. In case that the user selected a bad or short password, we stretch that password/key into a longer password/key. The aforementioned practice is also known as key stretching.

What we are going through this first phase is to promote key strengthening to slow down calculations which in turn also slow down attackers.

- [X] What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?

Header: contains metadata about the type of token and the cryptographic algorithms used to secure its contents. 

Payload(set of claims): constains verifiable security statements, such as the identity of the user and the permissions they are allowed. 

Signature: used to validate that the token is trustworthy and has not been tampered with. You must verify this signature before storing and using a JWT.


## Minimum Viable Product

Implement an User Authentication System. Hash user's passwords before saving them to the database. Use `JSON Web Tokens` or `Sessions and Cookies` to persist authentication across requests.

- [X] Implement the `register` and `login` functionality inside `/auth/auth-router.js`. A `user` has `username` and `password`. Both properties are required.
- [X] Implement the `authenticate` middleware inside `/auth/authenticate-middleware.js`.
- [ ] Write a **minimum o 2 tests** per API endpoint. Write more tests if you have time.

**Note**: the database already has the users table, but if you run into issues, the migrations are available.

## Stretch Problem

Build a front end to show the jokes.

- [ ] Add a React client that connects to the API and has pages for `Sign Up`, `Sign In` and showing a list of `Jokes`.
- [ ] Once you have the functionality down, style it!
